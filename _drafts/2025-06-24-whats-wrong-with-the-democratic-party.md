## Failure

### Failure by Consensus

*In an overconstrained system, there are no solutions.*

### Failure by the Status Quo

*If we cannot change, we cannot improve.*

### Failure by Inaction

*Inaction is a decision. A bad one.*

### Failure by Fear of Failure

*If God is for us, who can be against us?*

If a politician truly believes in the policy they propose, they should have no fear of . In fact, they have a duty to implement it as soon as possible to the benefit of people now.

"You don't win elections to bank political capital---you win elections to burn political capital and improve lives." - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz

### Failure by Surrender

## The Death Cycle

1. The Establishment blocks progressives from making change
2. We do not effect change
3. We do not improve people's lives
4. We lose elections
5. The Establishment gets scared
6. The Establishment blames progressives
7. The Establishment moves right
8. Repeat

## The Prophets

Bernie Sanders was a prophet.

David Hogg was a prophet.
