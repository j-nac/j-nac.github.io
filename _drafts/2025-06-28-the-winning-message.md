## We are incapable of properly evaluating leadership

In doing research for my liberal studies class EDUC 2410 "The Art of Teaching", I came across a book about leadership development. 

The perfect leader, making the perfect decisions with the perfect reasoning every time, could still get screwed.

## A progressive face forward

A uniting message for the moderates and progressives of the Democratic party is one that blends security in our basic values with a hope for a better future.

Democrats should center themselves around the working and middle class families.
