## Briefly

The Maladies are the collective negative thoughts that plague the American ethos.

## Division

### Trump is a Bad Leader

I, like many disgruntled Americans, have been thinking a lot about how Trump is a bad leader.

When we think about the qualities of a good leader, we might list off the following:

- Critical thinking
- Clear communication
- Decisive action
- Strong ethics
- Empathy and understanding
- Processing constructive criticism

Trump exhibits none of these. He has never clearly articulated a problem and proposed a clear solution with any degree of nuance. If you've paid any attention to the tariffs fiasco it's clear he lacks the ability to stick to a clear plan or think anything through. Trump is the kind of man to pay zero attention to meetings and golf 25 hours a day---he is more concerned with looking awesome than doing the real work.

To go on a bit of a tangent, Trump operates like a sensitive, unstable mob boss. He cannot allow himself to be near the people who will tell him what he needs to hear. If someone disagrees, he forces them out. He surrounds himself with yes men of the snakeish breed. Those who are smart take a note from Dale Carnegie's *How to Win Friends and Influence People*. Play the finesse game and always seem to be on his side while nudging him in your direction; trade your dignity for personal gain by stroking him off while tightening around the neck.

### Trump is a Bad Person

Back on track, the more important point I want to make is that Trump is a bad person.

- He believes that his power allows him to sexually abuse women
- And *has* sexually abused women
- He is an unfaithful husband
- He bullies people, all the way up to Sen. John McCain who was a Vietnam POW (for the sacrifice he made to our country)
- He is an incessant liar
- He is reckless
- He is incapable of admitting fault

While I don't think Trump is raging racist (though he is guilty of housing discrimination), he sure as hell is willing to capitalize on it and stoke the flames to detriment of America. He's an opportunist whom I doubt believes in God but takes advantage of Christian nationalism.

Trump is everything we raise our children, boys especially, to **not** be. He is a sinner that does not look for repentance.

### Trump Makes Us Bad People

As Trump parades around like a [fill in the blank] and gets away with it, the doors are swung up for raw sewage to pour into American culture. Had Trump not taken office, there would be no seat in Congress for the Marjorie Taylor Greenes of the world---they would've been shunned and ostracized. Today, it seems that fascists are more than willing to come out of the woodwork and show their faces. It's as if we've grown a tolerance, not for our fellow human beings but for hatred and bigotry.

My fear is that we are approaching a reality where this environment of hyper polarization is normalized---where we think division is part of what we are as Americans.

## Harsh Reality

### We're Screwed

Let's shift gears from talking about discourse around fixing our country to the state of American life. In short, we're screwed.

Every generation of America has had the outlook of living a better life than their forefathers. Millennials and Gen Z are getting the short end of the stick. We still live with our parents because we cannot afford housing. College is becoming more expensive, yet wages aren't increasing accordingly. AI, automation, and a host of other issues have killed our career outlook.



## Despair

### Why We're Losing Young Men

When you feel that your prospects are down and that there is nothing you can do to fix it, the natural disposition is despair.

Inceldom and a general dissatisfaction among young men in America is the predictable reaction to a hardened society. Many people (upsettingly, establishment Dems who claim we've gone "too woke") see culture wars as the reason young men have turned to Republicans. I believe that is a distraction.

Young men are conditioned to believe that they should be providers and that being providers is enough. They have been told that if they work as hard as their fathers, they will reap the same life---a stable, well-paying job to afford a house and provide for a family. This isn't the case anymore. Instead, men go to college without clear direction, drop out, get stuck in dead-end jobs, and then wrap themselves in self-hate.

Fascists and frauds fester in large groups of the dissatisfied. They will give simple solutions to complex problems and make promises to fix everything if they are given all the power.

For the Nazis, the hyperinflation of post WWI Germany caused by the Treaty of Versailles, paired with the memory of grave loss and horror of trench war, was the perfect environment to grow their ideology of hatred. Scapegoated Jews, Communists, homosexuals, and other minorities. They gave a very simple solution: extermination.

Today, right-wing conservatives capitalize on the dissatisfaction of young men by blaming feminists, LGBTQ, and "woke" ideology.

### Why We're Losing Minorities

Minorities turning to Republicans is the predictable reaction to slow Democratic policy failing to provide meaningful change. The Obama-era years of mass support for Democrats has gotten minorities... admittedly not much. If insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results, minorities are quite sane. If you've seen clips of Zohran Mamdani interviewing people who switched to Trump in 2024, it's clear that they're not so much attracted to the Republican platform as they are looking for something different.

### Why We're Losing Support

In short, we're losing support because life sucks and Democrats have been ineffective at meaningfully attacking the problem. Republicans win out on the country swirling the drain because they are willing to keep tossing the hot potato. They sell lies and spread bigotry because hate *feels good*. They cut taxes to pump the markets, only delaying the debt bomb. Meanwhile, Democrats drag their feet on change.

The problem with this despair, while expected, is that it does not help us fix our problems. Voting for Republicans will not fix anything.

## Humanity

### We Need to be Human Again

We are facing a crisis in being human.

It began with the Industrial Revolution and people being reduced to machines that perform repetitive tasks for a wage. It worsened with nuclear households and suburbia (I could go on a tangent about zoning and urban design) which has isolated us from extended family and complex structures of social support.

I recently rewatched Netflix's limited series *The Queen's Gambit* where Beth's adopted mother Alma is left a lost and drifting housewife. With her ambitions to be a piano player crushed, no job, no friends, and no caring family aside from Beth, she spends her days eating microwave dinners while watching the TV alone in the dark. To pacify her sorrows she takes green and white pills---tranquility medicine.

Today, those pills have transformed into social media and the internet which dulls our longing for real relationships.

People are starving for something more than just survival---purpose.

### Why Does This Matter?

Here is how everything I've discussed connects:

In one bubble, we have the reality of American life. Life sucks.

In another bubble is our perception of our reality and our collective identity as Americans.

We have a positive feedback loop of shittification.
