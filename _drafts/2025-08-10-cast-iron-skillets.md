I have recently acquired a 10-inch Lodge carbon steel skillet. Like my older cast iron skillet, I have quickly developed a fondness to the ironware.

A major difference between the skillet I received and the many you might see online is that the Lodge skillet was clearly cast in sand (like traditional cast iron skillets) rather than rolled and pressed as in typical stainless steel pans. The result is bumpy, rough surface. Unlike the French Matfer Bourgeat or De Buyer Mineral B carbon steel pans, one layer of seasoning was not sufficient for eggs to ["slide around like hockey pucks"](https://youtu.be/-suTmUX4Vbk). The smoother surface and polishing is reflected in a doubled price tag.

What is sacrificed in convenience can be made up for with effort and attention to detail.

I must have hard reset Windows on my old laptop dozens of times, and my current laptop at least a couple times on top of installing several different Linux distros, or the same one over and over to get a clean system again.
