The argument

1. We bear a moral responsibility to deliver for the working and middle class - also minorities
2. Conceding is a losing strategy which is causing us to fail our responsibility
3. We must not concede ground

## The Double Standard

**x** Innuendo Studios and you go high we go low

**x** Democrats are expected to

## A Promise



**x** Destiny, and tit for tat

It is unethical to not deliver.
