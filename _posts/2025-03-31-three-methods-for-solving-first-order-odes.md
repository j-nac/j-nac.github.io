First-Order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are differential equations that only contain first-order differentials ($\frac{dy}{dt}$). There are three main ways for solving first-order ODEs.

## Method 1: Separation by Parts

Separation of parts treats derivatives such as $$\frac{dy}{dt}$$ as variables $$dy$$ and $$dt$$.

## Method 2: Integrating Factor

## Method 3: Exactness
