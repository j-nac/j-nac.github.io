## Basic Laws

| Ohm's Law | Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) | Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $v = iR$ | $\sum i = 0$ | $\sum v = 0$ |

## Simplification

## Voltage and Current Division

## Node Voltage Method

1. Set a node to ground. It will have a voltage defined as zero. You should typically set the node connected to the highest number of other nodes as ground.
2. Assign a variable for the voltage of every other node.

## Mesh Current Method
