## Introduction

For my EDUC 2410 "The Art of Teaching" class, I was required to write a paper and give a presentation on a topic of my choice related to education. I chose to relate my experience from Air Force ROTC to the class by doing a paper on teaching leadership---experiential exercises in particular.

Experiential exercises are any activities meant to simulate a real situation.
