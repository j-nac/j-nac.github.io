This is everything I've learned from taking ECE 2100---Intro to Circuits.

## DC Circuit Analysis

The basic idea in this stage is that you have limited information on some DC circuit and you must use the information you have to find some other values---often the current through a certain area, a voltage, or creating some equivalent circuit.

## Intro to AC Circuits

Now we consider that current changes with time.

## Thinking Beyond Time

Kirchhoff's laws remain true when capacitors and inductors are used. However, in the time domain, they are differential equations that can be incredibly difficult to solve. Luckily, with transforms, we can convert our functions to another domain, use the traditional methods of circuit analysis, and convert them back to have the correct solutions.
