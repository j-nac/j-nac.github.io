## Laplace Transform

The Laplace transform is the most comprehensive transform method.

- Uses the complex-frequency domain (the s-domain)
- Works for both transient and steady-state response
- Works in circuits with initial conditions

## Fourier Transform

You can convert from the s domain to the frequency domain by simply specifying $s = j\omega$.

- Uses the frequency domain ($\omega$)
- Signals must be periodic and absolutely integrable
- Will not work for initial conditions
- Good for analyzing frequency response

## Phasor Analysis

- Uses the phasor domain
- Signals must be sinusoidal
- Only calculates at one frequency
