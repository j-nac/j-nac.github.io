## Gauss's Law for Magnetism

Gauss's law for magnetism is simply

$$ \Phi_B = \oint \vec B\cdot d\vec A = 0 $$

This is different from [Gauss's law for electric fields]({% post_url 2025-05-15-electric-flux %}) as there cannot be point charges for magnets in the same way that there are electric point charges---the magnetic fields going out must return, resulting in a net zero magnetic flux for enclosed surfaces.
