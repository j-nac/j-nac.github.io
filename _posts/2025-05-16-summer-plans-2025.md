Hello,

I'm waiting in my cleaned-out dorm for my bus to SYR airport. I had planned to take a nap, but the moist heat and excitement of finally leaving foiled that plan. After a brief visit with my sister, I will have three months of "free" time to spend at home in Washington.

I use "free" in quotes, as I have plenty of work ahead of me:

- Work on setting up a cyber learning platform for Cornell Cybersecurity Club.
- Develop my personal cybersecurity skills so as to not be a fraud.
- Get my ducks in a row for making i5 Space at Cornell an official club.
- Create recruitment materials and plan for i5 club.

Taking a step back, there is plenty of room for me to heal and grow. While I felt this year has flown by, I also feel that I have aged significantly---the courses have been brutal. However, I believe that by changing my lifestyle, I can grow more resilient and hopefully be less stressed. While it is summer, I do want to keep to a moderately rigorous schedule of waking and sleeping early, exercising regularly, and studying. I also want to test more ways to get my life organized and be more productive. I'll try to give myself a week to rest before making more formal plans to spend the summer.

That's all for now.
