## Basic Operations

Consider complex numbers $z_1 = x_1+iy_1$ and $z_2 = x_2+iy_2$.

For addition and subtraction, simply combine like terms.

Addition: $z_1 + z_2 = x_1+x_2 + i(y_1+y_2)$

Subtraction: $z_1 - z_2 = x_1-x_2 + i(y_1-y_2)$

Multiplication and division are a bit more *complex*. I will provide the equations for now, but a better explanation for why (involving geometry) will be provided when considering polar form and phasors.

Multiplication: $z_1 \cdot z_2 = (x_1x_2-y_1y_2)+i(x_1y_2+y_1x_2)$

Division:

## Complex Conjugate

## Homogeneity

## Polar Form

## Phasors
