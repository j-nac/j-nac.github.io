There are several delay models of various real-world accuracy to model the response time between an input and an output.

- The zero delay model has no delay
- The constant delay model has a set time for delay such as 10 picoseconds
- The input-dependent constant delay model has a set delay for each constant input
- The transition- and input-dependent constant delay model considers previous state and sets time for switching from one to another
- There are many more models that may consider load or have linear or nonlinear time
