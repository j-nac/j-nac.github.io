## Synthesizable vs Nonsynthesizable

There are two parts to Verilog --- synthesizable and nonsynthesizable. The synthesizable part models real hardware where the nonsynthesizable part does not model real hardware and is instead the logic used for testing.

## Values

There are four possible values in Verilog:

- Logic 0
- Logic 1
- X (undefined behavior or that the value could be either zero or one)
- Z (floating)

## Basic Building

You can declare wire, in this case names 'a' with `wire a;`.

You can also define various gates. The first item is the output wire and the successive items are inputs. For example `not(y, a)` is a NOT gate with the input a and output y. You should declare wires first (at the very least for neatness and clarity), but gates can be declared in any order.

There are also modules that contain a group of behavior.
