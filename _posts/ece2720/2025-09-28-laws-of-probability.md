## Total Probability

The sum of probabilities is one.

## Additivity

You can add probabilities.

## Large Numbers

As you repeat something several times, the average will converge to the expected value.

## Independence

If $x$ and $y$ are independent variables, $f(x)$ and $g(y)$ are independent.

## Linearity of Expectations

The expected value of a sum of random variables is the same as the sum of the individual expected values, regardless of whether the variables are independent or dependent.

$$ E[ax+b] = aE[x] + b $$
