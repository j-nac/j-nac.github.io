There are three different diode models that give a more simplified or complete picture of how diodes work.

## Ideal

In the ideal model, we imagine that diodes have zero current (infinite resistance, open circuit) when negative voltage is applied and all current (zero resistance, short circuit) when positive voltage is applied.

## Constant Voltage

The constant voltage is like the ideal model except we add a minimum voltage $V_{D\text{ on}}$ before current is allowed to pass.

## Exponential

The exponential model is the most accurate model out of the three discussed in the course. The other models simplify the exponential model because with positive values, the exponential term quickly dominates.
