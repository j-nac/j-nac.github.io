## Summary

In *The World We Created at Hamilton High* by Gerald Grant, Grant describes the transformation of Hamilton High in the city of Median (a pseudonym for Nottingham High in Syracuse, NY) from a close-knit, predominantly white, yet liberal school to an integrated, "democratic," but socially distant community.

## Personal Thoughts

Apparently, racism isn't easy to solve.

## Themes

### The Moral Authority of Teachers

### School Ethos

### Trust

### The role of Teachers, Parents, Policy, and Culture

### Policy Matrix

### Three Types of Authority

## Questions

- What is a school's role in shaping moral character?
- How do we foster genuine community in schools?
- How do we define a *good* school?
