Recall the three basic methods for solving first order ODEs:

- Integration by parts for separable ODEs
- [Integrating Factors]({% post_url math2930/2025-05-12-integrating-factors %})
- [Exact ODEs]({% post_url math2930/2025-05-12-exact-odes %})

In an initial value problem, you will likely be given an ODE from which you can get the general solution via using one of the methods above. You will also need to find the coefficient values using initial conditions that will be supplied to you.
