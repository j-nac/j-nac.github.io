## Elementary Row Operations (ERO)

EROs are operations that can be performed on augmented matrices without modifying the solution set; in other words, you can perform as many EROs as you want and the matrix will still be equivalent to the original.

There are three EROs:

1. Interchange --- swapping one row with another.
2. Scaling --- multiplying all values in a row by a constant.
3. Replacement --- adding a scaled row to another.

$$\begin{bmatrix}
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
    2 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\
    3 & 4 & 2 & 13 \\
    1 & -5 & -2 & 0
\end{array}
\end{bmatrix}$$
