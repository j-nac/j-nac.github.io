An elementary matrix is any matrix that can be obtained by performing a single ERO on the identity matrix.

An interesting property of elementary matrices is that they are invertible, and the inverse matrix will be the operation to undo the ERO performed. For example, if the elementary matrix has row one scaled by three, the inverse would have row one scaled by a third.
