- An identity matrix is a square matrix of ones along the diagonal top left to bottom right and zeros everywhere else.
- The corresponding identity matrix for a square matrix $n\times n$ is simply an identity matrix of the same size.
- If a matrix is multiplied by its corresponding identity matrix, it will return the same matrix, so one can think of the identity matrix like a one in multiplication.
