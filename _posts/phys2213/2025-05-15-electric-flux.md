Electric flux is the electric field passing through some area. Very simply, it is

$$ \Phi_E = EA $$

Where $E$ is a constant electric field passing perfectly perpendicularly though area $A$.

## Gauss's Law

Gauss's Law is

$$ \Phi_E = \oint \vec E\cdot d\vec A = \frac{Q_\text{enc}}{\epsilon_0} $$

This essentially means that the net flux through an enclosed surface (like a sphere) is only the charge enclosed.
