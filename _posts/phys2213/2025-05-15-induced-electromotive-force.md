When the magnetic flux ($\Phi_B$) through the area of a wire loop changes, there will be an induced electromotive force in the loop to oppose the change.

## Faraday's Law

$$ \mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} $$

## Method for Solving

There are a few common ways the magnetic flux through an area can be changing:

- The magnetic field strength changes
- The area increases or decreases
- The area rotates
- The area moves between areas of different field strength
