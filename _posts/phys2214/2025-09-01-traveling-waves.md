- A traveling wave is a disturbance that propagates through a medium at $v$
- $v$ depends on the medium
- Particles in the medium osciallate but do not translate; traveling waves will carry energy and momentum but not mass

## Transverse vs Longitudinal

A transverse wave has particles in the medium moving perpendicular to the direction the wave propagates. Think of a guitar string plucked where the wave propagates side to side (along the string) while the actual mass of the string moves up and down.

A longitudinal wave has particles in the medium moving in the same direction of propagation. Think of sound particles moving in the same direction sound is transmitted.

## Ideal Wave

An ideal wave has constant speed and will not change shape.

An ideal wave has the follow properties:

1. Nondispersive --- velocity is the same for all wave shapes and sizes.
2. Linear --- the equation to describe motion in the medium is linear.
3. Undamped --- energy is not being lost or added.
