## Pulse Equation

$$ v_y = \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = \mp v\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} $$

The pulse equation relates the y velocity of particles in the medium ($v_y=\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$) with the speed ($v$) and slope of the wave ($\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$). This suggests a given particle in a transverse wave is moving fastest when its vertical position is at equilibrium and the wave has the greatest slope.

## Ideal Wave Equation

$$ a_y = \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = v^2\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} $$

The ideal wave equation relates the y acceleration of particles in the medium ($a_y=\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}$) with the speed and curvature of the wave ($\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}$). This suggests a given particle in a transverse wave has the greatest acceleration at the peak or trough.

## Ideal Transverse Waves on a String

For ideal transverse waves on a string, we make the following assumptions and approximations:

- Small slope and small angles
- Constant tension throughout
- The string has mass, but there is no force of gravity or damping

We use $\mu$ for the mass of string per unit length and $\tau$ for tension along the string.

$$ a_y = \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\tau}{\mu}\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} $$

$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{\tau}{\mu}} $$
