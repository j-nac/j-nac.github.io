Wave polarization describes how particles in a wave can move along more than just one dimension.

Linearly polarized waves move along a plane. The movement in each component is in phase.

Circular polarized waves have components $90^\circ$ out of phase. With circularly polarized waves, there is both left and right-hand polarization that will match how your fingers curl.
