## Waves on a String

## Kinetic Energy

Kinetic energy density is

$$ u_k = \frac{1}{2}\mu\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right)^2 $$

where $\mu$ is the mass per unit length of the string. Notice how this follows the kinetic energy equation

$$ K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$

Where $\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$ is the transverse velocity.

Be careful that first equation is the kinetic energy *density* so to get the total kinetic energy, you need to find the velocity for each segment and multiply.

## Potential Energy

Potential energy density is

$$ u_p=\frac{1}{2}\tau\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)^2 $$

where $\tau$ is the tension.

This makes sense because the slope of the string, $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$ is proportional with the stretch of the string which stores energy.

For waves in only one direction, $u_p = u_k$.

## Power

$$ P(x, t) = -\tau\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} $$

## Sound Waves

$$ u_k = \frac{1}{2}\rho\left(\frac{\partial s}{\partial t}\right)^2 $$

$$ u_p = \frac{1}{2}B\left(\frac{\partial s}{\partial x}\right)^2 $$
