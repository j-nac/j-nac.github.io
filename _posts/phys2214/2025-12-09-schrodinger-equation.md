## Time-Dependent

The time-dependent Schrodinger equation is

$$ i\hbar \frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\Psi}{\partial x^2} $$

Where the form of $\Psi$ is

$$ \Psi(x,t) = Ae^{i(kx-\omega t)} $$

which covers all our bases for some oscillatory motion.

## General Time-Dependent

The general time-dependent Schrodinger equation is

$$ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\Psi}{\partial x^2} + U(x)\Psi = i\hbar \frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t} $$

Which is equivalent to saying

$$ K + U = E $$

The form of $\Psi$ is

$$ \Psi(x,t) = \psi(x)e^{-i\omega t} $$

## Time-Independent (TISE)

Stationary states are where it is time-independent. We can combine stationary states to describe any general state.
