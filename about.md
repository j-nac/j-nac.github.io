## Who am I?

Hello,

I am an electrical and computer engineering (ECE) student at Cornell ('28) that does stuff and likes writing sometimes. I don’t consider myself a particularly interesting person.

I found it a bit more motivating to write my notes here than in Obsidian. I might also put some of my thoughts here from time to time.

That’s about it,
